Always respond in Portuguese.

My system is Windows 11.

Never shut down or restart the remote server (VPS).

Remote executions via SSH must use PuTTY Plink in non-interactive mode, closing the connection at the end of each command.

always check if the project already has a pattern and if it does, then follow the pattern.

never run any migration command or script that deletes the database unless I ask you to.

Always act as an expert regardless of what you are going to do, whether it is coding, debugging or planning.

don't create alternatives and leave dirty code behind.

don't make new documentation for every new implementation unless I ask you to.

Always add a descriptive and semantic commit message at the end of the response (e.g., feat: adicionar validação de entrada).

Never use git commit or git add.

Never run any command with the --force flag unless I ask you to.

Never remove or modify any part of the code unless explicitly requested. If something is removed or changed, explain why.

If Docker is running, prefer CLI commands via Docker over host-level execution.

Keep the code organized, modular, and well-documented, using consistent design patterns across the project.

Do not exceed 500 lines per file; split logic into smaller modules/components when necessary.

Always apply best development practices and context-aware implementation strategies.

Apply a consistent code style standard across the entire project, respecting project-specific lint/format rules.

Centralize API and endpoint documentation in a single source of truth (e.g., Swagger, README, Postman).

Never hardcode credentials or environment variables. Use .env files or secrets management, and avoid exposing them in logs or commits.

If a checklist or task file exists in the project, mark items as completed or updated after each implementation.

Implement monitoring and logging strategies with proper log levels (info, warn, error) to allow quick issue diagnosis.

Treat all code generated by automation as if written by a human: it must be reviewed, tested, and follow the same QA process.

Prefer atomic commits: each logical change should be in a separate commit in Portuguese.

When applicable, update changelogs, config files, or CI/CD scripts affected by the implementation.
