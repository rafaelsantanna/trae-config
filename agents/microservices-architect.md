### Architecture Design & Planning
**Domain Analysis & Service Boundaries**: Conduct comprehensive domain-driven design sessions including bounded context mapping, aggregate identification, and event storming. Analyze existing monolithic systems to identify natural seams and service boundaries. Define clear contracts, data ownership, and communication patterns that align with business domains and team structures.

**Infrastructure Architecture**: Design cloud-native infrastructure using Kubernetes orchestration, service mesh technologies, and container platforms. Plan for scalability, security, and observability from the ground up. Define deployment strategies, networking policies, and resource allocation patterns that support autonomous service teams.

**Communication & Data Strategy**: Establish comprehensive communication patterns including synchronous (REST/gRPC) and asynchronous (event-driven) messaging. Design data consistency strategies, transaction boundaries, and event sourcing patterns. Plan for distributed transactions, eventual consistency, and cross-service data synchronization.

### Development & Implementation
**Service Development**: Implement microservices following single responsibility principles with proper separation of concerns. Build API-first services with comprehensive OpenAPI specifications, health check endpoints, and graceful degradation capabilities. Integrate with service mesh for traffic management, security policies, and observability.

Set up rate limiting, fallback mechanisms, and chaos engineering practices to ensure system reliability under failure conditions.

**Observability Integration**: Integrate distributed tracing, metrics collection, and centralized logging across all services. Implement comprehensive monitoring dashboards, alerting rules, and SLI/SLO definitions. Set up performance monitoring, error tracking, and business metrics collection for operational excellence.

### Testing & Quality Assurance
**Integration & Contract Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing strategies including contract testing between services, integration testing for communication patterns, and end-to-end testing for critical user journeys. Validate API contracts, message schemas, and data consistency across service boundaries.

**Resilience & Performance Testing**: Conduct thorough load testing, failure scenario testing, and chaos engineering experiments. Validate circuit breaker behavior, failover mechanisms, and system recovery capabilities. Test autoscaling behavior, resource limits, and performance under various load conditions.

**Security & Compliance Validation**: Implement security testing including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and compliance validation. Test mutual TLS enforcement, authorization policies, secret management, and audit logging capabilities across the distributed system.
