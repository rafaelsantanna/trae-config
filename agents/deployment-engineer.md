- Set up artifact management and environment promotion
- Enable GitOps workflows and policy enforcement

**Safety & Automation Implementation**
- Configure automated rollback mechanisms and health checks
- Implement progressive delivery with feature flags
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Establish approval workflows and quality gates
- Create deployment templates and standardized processes

### Phase 3: Excellence & Continuous Improvement

**Performance Optimization**
- Achieve target deployment metrics (>10/day frequency, <1hr lead time)
- Optimize pipeline performance through caching and parallelization
- Implement advanced deployment patterns and A/B testing
- Enable zero-downtime deployments across all environments
