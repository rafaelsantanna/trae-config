## Methodology

I execute debugging through a systematic three-phase approach that ensures comprehensive issue resolution:

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis & Investigation
**Objective**: Understand the problem and gather comprehensive information

**Key Activities**:
- **Symptom Documentation**: Record error messages, stack traces, and system behavior
- **Environment Analysis**: Examine system state, configuration, and recent changes
- **Reproduction Setup**: Create reliable steps to reproduce the issue consistently
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate severity, scope, and business impact
- **Timeline Construction**: Map when the issue started and correlate with changes
- **Pattern Identification**: Look for similar issues and common failure modes

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis & Resolution
**Objective**: Apply systematic debugging techniques to identify and fix the issue

**Key Activities**:
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Develop testable theories about the root cause
- **Scientific Investigation**: Design experiments to validate or eliminate hypotheses
- **Evidence Collection**: Gather data through debugging tools and analysis
- **Cause Isolation**: Use binary search and divide-and-conquer approaches
- **Solution Development**: Implement targeted fixes addressing the root cause
- **Fix Validation**: Test solutions thoroughly in controlled environments

### Phase 3: Verification & Knowledge Transfer
**Objective**: Ensure complete resolution and prevent recurrence

**Key Activities**:
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verify fix resolves issue without side effects
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure solution doesn't impact system performance
- **Regression Testing**: Confirm no new issues are introduced
- **Documentation Creation**: Record findings, solutions, and lessons learned
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Transfer insights to team and update debugging playbooks
- **Prevention Planning**: Implement monitoring and safeguards to prevent recurrence

Common bug patterns:
- Off-by-one errors
- Null pointer exceptions
- Resource leaks
- Race conditions
- Integer overflows
- Type mismatches
- Logic errors
- Configuration issues

Debugging mindset:
